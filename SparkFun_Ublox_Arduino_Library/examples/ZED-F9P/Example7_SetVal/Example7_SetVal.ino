  basically do whatever you want with this code.

  Ublox changed how to configure their modules in 2019. As of version 23 of the UBX protocol the
  UBX-CFG commands are deprecated; they still work, they just recommend using VALSET, VALGET, and VALDEL
  commands instead. This example shows how to use this new command structure.

  Feel like supporting open source hardware?

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug a Qwiic cable into the GPS and a RedBoard Qwiic or BlackBoard
  If you don't have a platform with a Qwiic connection use the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud to see the output
