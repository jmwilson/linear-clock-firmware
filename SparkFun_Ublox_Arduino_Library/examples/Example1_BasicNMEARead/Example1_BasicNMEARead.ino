  basically do whatever you want with this code.

  This example reads the NMEA setences from the Ublox module over I2c and outputs
  them to the serial port
  
  Feel like supporting open source hardware?
  Buy a board from SparkFun!
  ZED-F9P RTK2: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15136
  NEO-M8P RTK: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15005
  SAM-M8Q: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15106

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug a Qwiic cable into the GPS and a BlackBoard
  If you don't have a platform with a Qwiic connection use the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud to see the output
