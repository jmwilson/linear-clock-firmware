  basically do whatever you want with this code.

  This example reads the NMEA characters over I2C and pipes them to MicroNMEA
  This example will output your current long/lat and satellites in view
 
  Feel like supporting open source hardware?
  Buy a board from SparkFun!
  ZED-F9P RTK2: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15136
  NEO-M8P RTK: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15005
  SAM-M8Q: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15106

  For more MicroNMEA info see https://github.com/stevemarple/MicroNMEA

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug a Qwiic cable into the GPS and a BlackBoard
  If you don't have a platform with a Qwiic connection use the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud to see the output
  Go outside! Wait ~25 seconds and you should see your lat/long
